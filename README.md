# JS slider for the final project of REvive's seminar

1. Create an element with an id in your html, as a container for the slider.
2. Load the script with: `<script src="slider.js"></script>`
3. (optional) Edit the config array in slider.js to suit your preference, or create your own, respecting its structure.
4. Run with: `slider('elementId', config);`

Note: Input your element's id without the '#'. If you created your own configuration, use its variable name instead of 'config'.
