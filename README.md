# JS slider for the final project of REvive's seminar
## In progress...

1. Create an element with an id in your html, as a container for the slider.
2. Then add this to your html:
```<script src="slider.js"></script>
<script>
  slider('elementId', config);
</script>```
3. (optional) Edit the config array in slider.js to suit your preference, or create your own, respecting its structure.

Note: Input your element's id without the '#'. If you created your own configuration, use its variable name instead of 'config'.
