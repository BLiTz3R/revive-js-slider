# JS slider for the final project of REvive's seminar

1. Create a div with an id in your html. 
2. Load the script with: `<script src="slider.js"></script>`
3. Edit the config array in script.js to suit your preference, or create your own, respecting its structure. Leave as it is for default values.
4. Run with: `slider('elementId', config);`

Note: Input your div's id without the '#'. If you created your own configuration, use its variable name instead of 'config'.
